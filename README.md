# **M**ulti**D**raw**CPP**

MDCPP is a small OpenGL wrapper, intended to be a hobbyist (me/mine) replacement for SFML. It offers a reasonable abstraction layer over the OpenGL API, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Motivation

Previously on all my "graphics" projects (excluding Raytracing), I used SFML as a simple library to draw stuff, however I found SFML too slow with their graphics pipeline especially for the stuff I did [here](https://github.com/sacreative10/BPHOComputationalChallenge/tree/ExtensionSphere). So I sought out to create my own smaller mini-SFML, just to learn somewhat how they work, and hopefully get more acquainted to OpenGL.

## Usage
Please see example/ on how to use the currently implemented items in MDCPP.
